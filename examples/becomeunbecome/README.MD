# Switchable Behaviors

Actors have the power to switch their behaviors at any point in time. This is usually referred as *becoming something*, 
as in *the actor becomes busy* or *the actor becomes connected*.

This is accomplished by replacing the method that handles messages inside the actor using `Become` or `BecomeStacked`. 
These methods accept a delegate that will handle the next messages until you decide to replace it again.

This is a powerful concept that is behind other features like Finite State Machines.

> **Note:**<br /> When you change the actor behavior, the new behaviour will take effect for all subsequent messages 
until the behaviour is changed again. The current message will continue processing with the existing behaviour. 
You can use [Stashing](Stashing Messages) to reprocess the current message with the new behavior.

```go
...

type Become struct{}
type Hello struct{ Who string }
type BecomeActor struct{}

func (state *BecomeActor) Receive(context actor.Context) {
	switch msg := context.Message().(type) {
	case Hello:
		fmt.Printf("Hello %v\n", msg.Who)
		context.Become(state.Other)
	}
}

func (state *BecomeActor) Other(context actor.Context) {
	switch msg := context.Message().(type) {
	case Hello:
		fmt.Printf("%v, ey we are now handling messages in another behavior", msg.Who)
	}
}

func NewBecomeActor() actor.Actor {
	return &BecomeActor{}
}

func main() {
	props := actor.FromProducer(NewBecomeActor)
	pid := actor.Spawn(props)
	pid.Tell(Hello{Who: "Roger"})
	pid.Tell(Hello{Who: "Roger"})
	console.ReadLine()
}
